HW2 Probabilistic Robotics - Daniel Choate 
Particle Filter implementation 

Run <main.py> with python 3. Requires <HW2_utils.py>, as well as numpy, openCV, and matplotlib libraries

To change the reference image shape, change variable 'm' (line 62 in <main.py>). This can also be changed to include [50,100,150].
To get an average of 10 trials, change variable 'trials' to 10 (line 58 in <main.py>) (beware of dramatically increased run time).
