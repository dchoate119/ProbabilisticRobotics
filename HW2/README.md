HW2 Probabilistic Robotics - Daniel Choate 
Particle Filter implementation 

Run <main.py> with python 3. Requires <HW2_utils.py>, as well as numpy, openCV, and matplotlib libraries

To change the reference image shape, change variable 'm' (line *** in <main.py>)
To get an average of 10 trials, change variable 'trials' to 10 (line *** in <main.py>) (beware of increased run time)

To run experiment comparing different reference image shapes (50,100,150), change line *** of <main.py> to include [50,100,150] (beware of dramatically increased run time)
